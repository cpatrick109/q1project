-assign values to the cards

-fix being able to deal multiple times

-when hand is over clear the divs

-make a function to add card values(if over 21 you lose, if dealer > 21 you win, if your value > dealer value you win, if dealer value = player value, push)

-when you hit, append the next card to playercards rather than appending to playerCard3-5
